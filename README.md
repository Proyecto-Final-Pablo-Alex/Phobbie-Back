# PHOBBIE

Phobbie is our React Full-Stack project for the final module at the Ironhack's Web Dev Bootcamp. We built it **mobile first**, and still working on making it available for desktop or tablet. We've used mainly ReactJs and many backend npm packages and modules but in resume: Axios to connect with our backend's API; NodeJS and ExpressJs for the routes and server of our API; Passport and BcryptJs for authentication, Cloudinary for file uploads and MongoDB for the data base. For the front we've used ReactJs and SASS for the customization. 

Phobbie is social network application where you can connect with other people who share your same hobbies. You can add them as friends and even chat with them with a live chat. We've implemented our own live chat without any other packages or libraries. We've also implemented a dark and light mode.

As we said, at the moment it's only available for mobile phones. We will soon come back with the desktop version.
